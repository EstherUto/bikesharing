## Table of Contents

## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the trends of Citi Bike users in New York City. The hope is the success of Citi Bike in New York would give insights into the potential of a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results

To achieve these results, the City Bike rideshare data for August 2019 `201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip` was used and retrieved from [Citi Bike's System Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) [web page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html).

The resulting Tableau Workbook can be viewed and/or downloaded online at a personal [Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYC-August-2019-Citibike/NYCBikingStoryAugust2019?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The dashboard shows over 2 million people made use of the bikes in one August of 2019 with a majority being male. The map images show that the usage starting locations are clustered in a general area which could mean one or more of the following:
- There are more bikes available in those location
- There are more people living in this particular area
- This area may be filled with tourist spots that would be enjoyed better on the bikes
- The area is very bike friendly i.e. lots of bike lanes

### Checkout Time Dashboard

When looking at the checkout times dashboard, it seems most of the bikes are checked out at the 5 to 6 minute mark of the hour no matter the gender. The graphs also show no matter the gender, the duration of most rides are less than one hour.

### Trips per Weekday, Hour, Gender, Usertype

The final dashboard shows what time of the day and what day of the week the trips occur. This dashboard also shows if the users are single use customers or subscribers. The graph images show that majority of riders are subscribers which show that people who are interested in biking believe that the service is good enough to subscribe to. Slide 2 shows most riders ride for less than 1 hour, if most check-ins are at 6pm, it shows most rides happend between 5 pm and 6pm. Thursdays also seem to be the preffered day of the week for riding.

## Summary

From the story formed by the dashboard, it is safe to say bikesharing has a good potential to be successful in areas where there are:
- tourist locations
- bike lanes for safe bike riding
- large dense population
- close by stands for those who need a quick ride
- mantainance can be done during odd hours (i.e. ealry morning 2 AM to 5 AM)

Other visualizations that can be done with the data include:
- Starting locations by gender which shows if there is a particular area groups of people choose to checkout bikes. *See image below*

- Knowing the age group of those who make use of the service would help to gear to the customer base. It would also help to know which groups of people that the business should try and draw in. *See image below*

- Besides knowing the age group of people, knowing which age range is most likely to subscribe to the service would help with being aware of how to appeal to certain age groups to encourage subscription. *See image below*
